## ✅ Summary of Key Issues (Resolved)

### 1️⃣ TypeScript Errors in Backend Controller

**Problem**: The controller `website-idea.controller.ts` was referencing three methods — `getAvailableWebsiteTypes`, `isValidWebsiteType`, and `getSectionsForType` — on the `SectionGeneratorService` class. These methods did not exist, resulting in TypeScript compilation errors:

```
src/controllers/website-idea.controller.ts:135:50 - error TS2339: Property 'getAvailableWebsiteTypes' does not exist on type 'SectionGeneratorService'.
src/controllers/website-idea.controller.ts:151:41 - error TS2339: Property 'isValidWebsiteType' does not exist on type 'SectionGeneratorService'.
src/controllers/website-idea.controller.ts:155:53 - error TS2339: Property 'getSectionsForType' does not exist on type 'SectionGeneratorService'.
```

These errors indicate that the backend was attempting to use service logic that hadn't been defined, breaking API functionality and preventing successful compilation.

**Fix**: Added the missing methods in `SectionGeneratorService` with the following responsibilities:

* `getAvailableWebsiteTypes()`: returns all supported website types with metadata
* `isValidWebsiteType()`: verifies that a given type is supported
* `getSectionsForType()`: returns a flattened list of all section templates for a given type

Each method uses the internal `sectionVariations` object to derive structured output and includes appropriate validation.

**File Updated**: `backend/src/services/section-generator.service.ts`

### 2️⃣ Hydration Warning in Frontend (React)

**Problem**: During server-side rendering (SSR), a random placeholder was generated for an input field using `Math.random()`. When React rehydrated the component on the client, it regenerated a different placeholder value. This caused a mismatch between the server-rendered HTML and the client-rendered DOM — a common hydration issue in React apps.

**Console Warning**:

```
Warning: A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
```

**Fix**:

* Removed `Math.random()` from the initial `useState` call.
* Set a fixed default placeholder for initial render (SSR-safe).
* Used `useEffect()` to generate a new random placeholder **after** the component mounts on the client side.

**Result**: Ensures consistent server and client HTML, resolves hydration warning.

**File Updated**: `frontend/src/components/WebsiteIdeaForm.tsx`

**Result**: Clean build and proper hydration
